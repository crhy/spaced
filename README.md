Spaced Peppermint Agile Compiz Emulation Devuan

Our goal is to provide an extremely user friendly and comprehensively useful lightweight version of Devuan.  Built on the rolling release version of Devuan (Daedalus), and utilizing some of the very useful Peppermint Devuan flavor integrations.  We also intend to fork some Linux Mint code upstream.

The Distribution will focus heavily on flatpak integration to keep itâ€™s most popular apps very up to date.

The Desktop will be based on Mate, and Compiz, to be both very lightweight, and yet incredibly useful and gorgeous.
