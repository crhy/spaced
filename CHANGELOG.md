# Changelog

## 7.26.5 - 2026-08-01
- Replaced the Voice2Text screenshot with the current 1920x1080 capture in the Calamares slideshow, on the website showcase, and in the README gallery.
- Fixed the double volume icon by disabling the mate-media tray applet autostart so only the panel's GvcApplet renders.
- Unified all 9 panel layouts: every theme now uses the identical applet set (Brisk Menu, Window List, Volume, Notification Area, Clock, Show Desktop) with locked panels, differing only by orientation. Android and Mac OS X place the panel on top with the cairo-dock at the bottom; all other themes keep the bottom panel.

## 7.26.4 - 2026-07-31
- Fixed the live-build debootstrap failure by excluding dhcpcd-base, which depends on systemd packages that Devuan does not provide.
- Guaranteed a systemd-free system: only the standalone systemd-standalone-sysusers and systemd-standalone-tmpfiles helpers are used, never systemd itself.
- Fixed the mate-session-manager dependency conflict: spaced-mate-default-settings now Provides an exact-version debian-mate-default-settings plus mint and ubuntu variants, with matching Conflicts and Replaces, so the MATE session can start.
- Fixed the panel "VolAppletFactory::VolumePagerApplet" loading error by switching all 9 panel layouts from the obsolete MATE 1.x volume applet IID to GvcAppletFactory::GvcApplet (MATE Panel 1.27).
- Fixed the Compiz default effects: Clone Output and Expo are now disabled by default, and Paint fire on the screen (firepaint) is enabled. Distracting wobbly/animation effects remain off.

## 7.26.3 - 2026-07-28
- Fixed the GRUB Unicode font warning and restored the Spaced boot background.
- Safe Graphics now keeps normal display modes available instead of forcing the old 800x600 framebuffer.
- Added 1024x768 and 1920x1080 QEMU test targets.
- Pinned live builds to a fixed Devuan mirror and added retry handling for the MATE session package download.
